# Simple-Rest-Api-Nodejs-Express-Mongodb
This is a simple backend that allows a user to CRUD todos. The todos are stored in Mongodb and the backend is built with Express and Nodejs. It's hosted on Heroku.

It's meant to work with my other repository named [Redux-Typescript-Test](https://github.com/ryann254/Redux-Typescript-Test).

To run the backend, simply do a `git clone https://github.com/ryann254/Simple-Rest-Api-Nodejs-Express-Mongodb.git`, cd into the cloned project, then do a `yarn install`. Lastly type in `yarn run dev` in your terminal to run the project.
